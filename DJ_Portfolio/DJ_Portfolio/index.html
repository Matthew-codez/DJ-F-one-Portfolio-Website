                <p>"Whenever we find ourselves watching videos of our wedding day, it's pure Nostalgia! We would go back to enjoy that day as much as we did yes but we simply wouldn't change a thing!
                    I'm talking about the entire day because everything was in sync. We didn't have one problem with sound or music and I think that's so important for an event to run smoothly.
                    Initial communication with us was brief but you got it down to the T. We shared our music genres with you, we shared the venue and event details so you could prepare sound and lighting appropriately and you delivered.
                    The wedding party arrived earlier than anticipated yet the set up for sound and music was done and ready for action. Punctual and well presented!
                    We didn't ever have to come speak to you or signal you because you were prepared with order of events and your communication with the event coordinator was fantastic. You played the songs as requested for each activity eg walking in song, first dance etc. And where we didn't request you just read the crowd, and it flowed. Not one moment of silence. Great attention to detail.
                    Mic set up for speeches were flawless, no faulting at
                    all.
                    Quality sound reached the entire audience. And the lighting for dancing was just amazing!
                    The seats were literally empty at our wedding, because everyone was on the dance floor! We got so many compliments days to follow, saying it was the best wedding they've been to in years! Your sound and lighting service was so good, I've reccommended it to many other friends and family, of which 3 people used within the following year, also with great experience.
                    This all within the midst of covid with restrictions and different protocols in place, you've still managed to deliver a memorable night that we will cherish forever. We are eternally grateful Shawn Ferreira!!"</p>
